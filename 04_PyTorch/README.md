# PyTorch tutorial
This is an introduction to PyTorch. We aim to cover main aspects such as tensor manipulation, Autograd, training models and some examples.

## Acknowledgments
Some of the basic tutorial codes are based on [jcjohnson's PyTorch basic examples](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples). Other sources and examples are taken directly from PyTorch documentation.
