# Convolutional Neural Networks for classification
In this tutorial you are going to learn how to train a CNN for a classification problem. We are going to cover the following topics:

* Explore different architectures and their definition in PyTorch (AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet, VGG).

* Learn to save and load models to resume trainig.

* How to do finetuning of a model.

## Homework July 5
Run the fine_tuning.py code with the model that you want and save the best model (the train_model function returns it) 
as a checkpoint. To load the model you have just saved, first initialize the model using the initialize_model function (there is no need to use pretrained weights), and then load the weights from the checkpoint.
