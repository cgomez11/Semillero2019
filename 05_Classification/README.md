# Convolutional Neural Networks for classification
In this tutorial you are going to learn how to train a CNN for a classification problem. We are going to cover the following topics:

* Explore different architectures and their definition in PyTorch (AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet, VGG).

* Learn to save and load models to resume trainig.

* How to do finetuning of a model.
